# The analysis & optimization engine

Reference implementation of the agent-centric engine (ADR-0010). Every piece here was
first de-risked as a spike under `analytics/spikes/` (see the validation ledger,
`analytics/docs/adr/adr-0012-...`). Pure standard library — no app runtime deps — so it
imports and unit-tests cleanly and is reusable from both the Travel API and the Fabric
analysis notebook.

## Folder map (by functional area)

| Folder | What it owns | Extend by |
|---|---|---|
| `core/` | shared types (`NodeExec`), the `Registry`, cost primitives | — |
| `instrumentation/` | node-grain capture from the LangGraph event stream (Layer 1) | — |
| `complexity/` | realized-complexity signal (measured tokens) vs the keyword tier | — |
| `detectors/` | detectors (structural / counterfactual / statistical) | **add a module + `@DETECTORS.register`** |
| `policy/` | the binding SDK (typed params, validate/clamp, fail-closed) | — |
| `policy/domains/` | one policy domain per module | **add a module + `@DOMAINS.register`** |
| `projection/` | projection functions + What-If (scaling, cost-per-outcome) | **add a module + `@PROJECTIONS.register`** |
| `analyst/` | recommendation cards + the five guardrails (LLM proposes / engine computes) | — |
| `quality/` | reference-free quality judge + per-agent rubrics + calibration | **add a rubric + `@RUBRICS.register`** |
| `codecontext/` | read-only code retrieval so the analyst can draft a diff (no write path) | — |
| `seams/` | the declared optimizable surface + recipe rendering (the seam ladder) | **add a `register(Seam(...))`** |
| `autonomy/` | measure → verdict → auto-revert guard (config seam) | — |
| `learning/` | outcome ledger + feedback (re-rank + calibrate) | — |
| `scorecard/` | agent × dimension health rollup (Layer 2 surface) | **add a scorer + `@DIMENSIONS.register`** |
| `simulation/` | agent-structured synthetic telemetry (no LLM) | tune paths/profiles |

## The one extension gesture

Every pluggable area uses the same `core.Registry`, so adding functionality is always the
same move — create a module in the folder and decorate:

```python
# detectors/my_detector.py
from .base import DETECTORS, Detection

@DETECTORS.register("structural.my_pattern")
def my_pattern(nodes):
    ...
    return Detection(detector="structural.my_pattern", kind="structural", ...)
```

Then add `from . import my_detector` to that folder's `__init__.py` so it registers on
import. (Same pattern for `policy/domains/` and `projection/`.)

## Quick use

```python
from src.app.engine import simulation, detectors, projection

nodes = simulation.simulate(seed=1, n_turns=1000)     # or real node-grain telemetry
findings = detectors.run_all(nodes)                    # what's wrong, per agent × dimension
saving = projection.project("opp-modelfit-supervisor", nodes)  # what it's worth
```

The **agent scorecard** rolls the same node-grain up into per-agent health across every
registered dimension (the surface the Console / report read):

```python
from src.app.engine import scorecard

cards = scorecard.build_scorecard(nodes)          # one AgentScorecard per agent
print(scorecard.format_scorecard(cards))          # or: data/agent_scorecard.py --simulate 1000
```

Only the dimensions node-grain can actually measure today (cost efficiency, model
selection, workflow efficiency) are scored; the rest are listed with the signal each
one still needs, so nothing is fabricated. Add one by registering a scorer in
`scorecard/dimensions.py`.

## Self-test

```
cd 02_completed/python
python -m src.app.engine._selftest        # exit 0 = the whole engine wires + works
```
