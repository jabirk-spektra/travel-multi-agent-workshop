"""
Agent-centric analysis & optimization engine (ADR-0010).

Reference implementation of the engine whose pieces were de-risked as spikes under
`analytics/spikes/` (see ADR-0012). Each functional area is its own small package;
importing this top-level package wires up every extension registry.

    from src.app.engine import detectors, projection, policy, analyst, autonomy, learning, simulation
    nodes = simulation.simulate(seed=1, n_turns=1000)
    findings = detectors.run_all(nodes)

See `README.md` for the folder map and how to add a detector / policy domain / projection.
