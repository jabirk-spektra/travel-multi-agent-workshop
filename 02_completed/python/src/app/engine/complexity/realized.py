"""
Realized-complexity signal (ADR-0010 §4.1, spike B6).

Two ways to judge a turn's complexity:

  * **Declared (keyword complexity_tier)** — classify the *user text* with hand-authored patterns
    BEFORE the turn runs. This is what the app's model-selection classifier does
    (`services.optimization.classify_complexity_tier`): conservative — only short greetings become
    "trivial", so it downgrades very few turns and leaves real savings on the table.

  * **Measured (realized complexity)** — read what the turn ACTUALLY produced: the
    node-grain output tokens. A turn that emitted very few output tokens WAS trivial,
    regardless of how its prompt read. This is the signal the engine's counterfactual
    `model_fit` detector already uses.

This module makes the measured signal a first-class, reusable primitive and provides a
head-to-head comparison so the "finds more opportunity than the keyword complexity_tier" claim is
checkable on labeled data (see `_selftest`). It stays pure stdlib — a small mirror of the
app's classifier lives here so the comparison is self-contained (the app module carries
heavy runtime deps the engine deliberately avoids).
