"""
The analysis pipeline — the loop, wired (ADR-0010 Layer 2).

    detect (detectors) -> project (engine computes saving) -> propose (analyst) ->
    guardrail (validate/normalize) -> rank (outcome ledger) -> discovered opportunities

The `analyst` argument is where the LLM plugs in (it PROPOSES cards). The default is a
deterministic proposer so the whole loop runs and unit-tests without an LLM; a real
LLM analyst is a drop-in that returns the same `RecommendationCard` shape. Either way
the guardrails and the engine-computed saving are authoritative (LLM proposes / engine
computes).
